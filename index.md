## Welcome to Hörmet's (pron.: /hør'mɛt/) personal page!

My full name is Hörmetjan Yiltiz, while *-jan* being the suffix for male names in [Uyghur][] and *Yiltiz* (pron.: /jIl'tɪ̈z/) being the famliy name. My name can be transcripted in Chinese as 玉尔麦提江, and am oftentimes  called 玉尔麦 for short. You may just call me Hörmet for convenience, and I wouldn't mind if you cannot pronounce it well. If in trouble, just say hermit.

I study Psychology in [Peking University][], and very passionate about [Free Software][], Philosophy, Physics and Mathematics.
